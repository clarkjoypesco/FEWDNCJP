# Slack Card Workspace

Fix this Slack card up!

1. The buttons are very blocky. Change the CSS so that they have rounded corners of 4px.
2. There seems to be a typo in the top part of the card. I don't know what a 'Stufent' is, but that's probably not the word you want.
3. The font for the buttons doesn't match the rest of the card. Find a way to make the font the same.
4. We've provided a placeholder image for you. Set the placeholder as the background for the top of the card.
5. Change the cursor to be a hand pointer instead of an arrow over the buttons.
6. Have other ideas for how to change the card? Try them out! This is your workspace!
